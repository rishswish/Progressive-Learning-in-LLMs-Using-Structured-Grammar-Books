    "She serves as an impressive reminder of the great ships of the past.",
    "Before they were replaced by steamships, sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.",
    "The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.",
    "The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.",
    "Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872, on an exciting race to England.",
    "This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.",
    "It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.",
    "The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae, but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.",
    "It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home, but during the race, she had a lot of bad luck.",
    "In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.",
    "The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her.",
    "A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty.",
    "This greatly reduced the speed of the ship, for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly, this rudder would be torn away as well.",
    "Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.",
    "After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted, but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.",
    "Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.",

    "When men wanted to travel greater distances, across very large lakes or small seas, for example, boats needed to be larger.",
    "We have all seen pictures of ancient ships with rows of oars at each side and slaves to row them.",

    "The Viking ships that invaded Britain hundreds of years ago also reached North America.",
    "Later sailing ships, like those that Columbus sailed in, the galleons that formed the Spanish Armada, or those that Nelson sailed in, were an advance.",

    "For centuries, ships had depended on the wind to sail across the seas and oceans.",

    "Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport.",

    "It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives.",

    "It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave.",
    "Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer.",
    "The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble.",
    "It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet.",
    "This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunnelled a course through a flaw in the rocks.",
    "The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphiné Alps.",
    "As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable.",
    "The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger.",
    "Since its discovery, it has become a sort of pot-holers' Everest.",
    "Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.",
    "A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger.",
    "After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to a narrow corridor.",
    "They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams or swimming across deep pools.",
    "Suddenly, they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave.",
    "They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side.",
    "To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits.",
    "At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water.",
    "In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound, which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave.",
    "Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall.",
    "After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites — some of them over forty feet high — rising up like tree trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof.",
    "Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow.",
    "In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.",

    "As he was walking along the beach, he suddenly realized that the tide was coming in: it was coming in very fast, and he began to get a little worried.",
    "He walked faster, but soon the tide had reached the headland and there was no way that he could walk around.",
    "He looked round and saw a cave in the cliff.",
    "As he hoped to climb up inside it, he went in.",
    "Unfortunately, he just couldn't see a way out, so he started back.",
    "It was too late: the tide was coming into the cave and as he looked down from the point he had reached, the sea was already covering the floor of the cave and beginning to rise up the chimney in the cave.",

    "He had never been so frightened in his life.",
    "He promised himself that he would never do it again.",
    "In undertaking the descent of a really deep cave, a pot-holer may have to spend as much as a week planning his descent.",
    "The cave discovered by the French pot-holer, Berger, represents the ultimate challenge to any pot-holer who is truly dedicated.",
    "On reaching the enormous cavern, the pot-holers lit it up by using the arc lights they had carried down with them.",

    "There were about ten of them and they all jumped or climbed into the dish one by one.",
    "The first thing that happened was that they started slipping and sliding everywhere and all fell down in the bottom of the dish because it was SO smooth.",
    "They all laughed a lot.",
    "Then one of them turned on the large portable radio that he had brought with him and some of them started dancing. (At least there was no one near the canal to complain about the noise.)",
    "Suddenly, the dish began to move in the water.",
    "It went down one side, and then down one end, and the teenagers moved to the other end.",
    "Then it started dipping the end and they all slid into a pile.",
    "At that point, the rim of the dish reached the level of the water.",
    "Once that happened, the teenagers couldn't climb back up to the other end, and the water started pouring in.",
    "It capsized in minutes and sank in seven feet of water.",
    "Fortunately, they all managed to swim to the bank and were safe.",
    "The teenagers may not have done much damage, but if they hadn't held their party on the dish, it wouldn't have sunk and the insurance company wouldn't have had to pay to salvage it from the canal.",
    "In the case of the pie dish, the insurance company concerned was asked to pay the costs of the salvaging operation.",
    "When the pie dish had capsized, the men who came to recover it found it difficult to devise a way of getting it out of the water.",
    "The huge wave in the canal was caused by the great quantity of water which poured off the dish when they were getting it out.",
    "Eventually, the dish was successfully recovered by securing the winch chains with metal clamps and lifting it vertically.",
    "The bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the more you wiil have to pay as a premium.",

    "Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished.",
    "She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names.",
    "Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy, in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please.",

    "In 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA.",
    "It can properly be described as the first “home computer' and it pointed the way to the future.",

    "Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days.",
    "Bagrit foresaw a time when computers would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work.",

    "By the time I got home, it was six o'clock.",
    "I was absolutely exhausted, but pleased that I had managed to buy two things on my list.",
    "The essence of the joke, from Harry's point of view, was that he would take up the shop assistants' time without having to buy anything.",

    "He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman's care; but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me.",
    "He always meant to go back one day, but not to stay.",
    "His roots and mine had become too firmly embedded in the new land.",
    "But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother's grave.",
    "He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and, when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own.",
    "It was not that I actually remembered anything at all.",
    "But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone, after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory.",
    "Well, I had been wrong, for I was now lost.",
    "I looked at the map and then at the milometer.",
    "I had come ten miles since leaving the town, and at this point, according to my father, I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance.",
    "I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages, and no church spire - only a lake.",
    "I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere.",
    "So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map.",
    "I landed up at the same corner.",
    "The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map.",
    "I felt as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams.",
    "And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me.",
    "Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback, riding in my direction.",
    "I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village.",
    "He said that there was now no village.",
    "I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated his name.",
    "This time he pointed to the lake.",
    "The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too.",
    "The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir.",
    "In the place of the village, there was only a lake.",
    "Had he taken the wrong turning?",
    "He went back to town and retraced his route, only to finish up at the same spot.",
    "The lake was not marked.",
    "When a man on horseback appeared, the author asked the way to the old village.",
    "The horseman told him there was no village and pointed to the lake: it had been submerged with the whole valley under a man-made reservoir.",
    "There is a house in another part of my hometown that I would love to own.",
    "It is called the 'White House', like the President's house in Washington!",
    "I think you could easily describe it as a 'mansion', and it is magnificent.",
    "I have no idea how much it is worth, but that doesn't worry me.",
    "I admire the house and have always admired it I do not have to imagine what the house is like inside because I have, strange as it may seem, actually been inside.",
    "About three years ago, the owner held an exhibition of sculptures and paintings in the house.",
    "The exhibits were distributed throughout the house SO that all the visitors had a chance to see the house.",
    "When you go in through the large, heavy green front door, you find yourself in a large entrance hall with a shining black and white marble floor, rooms leading off from it in all directions, and a large open staircase leading up to the first floor.",
    "There is a large dining room on the right and a large sitting room on the left.",
    "Both rooms have big windows that look out onto the front lawn.",
    "There are always peacocks on the front lawn, and there are two large oak trees where you can sit in the shade on hot summer days.",
    "At the back of the house is a large kitchen, a laundry, a work room, and a games room.",
    "Upstairs, there are six bedrooms and four bathrooms.",
    "I think there are four bathrooms, but I can't quite remember.",
    "The house is full of beautiful antique furniture and all the rooms are decorated in a classical style-lots of light blue and light green paint with white doors, and quite a lot of gold decoration.",
    "The whole thing may sound like a dream, but one day it will be reality.",
    "One day, I will own my ideal house.",
    "When the author thought he was near his objective, he stopped because he did not recognize any familiar landmarks.",
    "Why did the author's father want his son to go back on his own? He had always intended that his son should see the land of their birth.",
    "What made the author feel he had stumbled into a nightmare country? Nothing he saw corresponded to what he had expected to see.",

    "In the lift, her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest, but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open.",
    "She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, when she spots of bother remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left, and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks.",
    "She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice, she had shut them before going out.",
    "Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk.",
    "It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence.",
    "Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the porter from his basement.",
    "By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, SO she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police, Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for any intruders who might still be lurking in her flat.",
    "They went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints.",
    "The chaos was inconceivable.",
    "She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding, and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and 20 turned over and over.",
    "At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her.",
    "Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat.",
    "The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony.",
    "There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewelry, which the old lady said was not hers.",
    "So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars' first job that day and they must have been disturbed.",
    "The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights.",
    "The old lady thought he was a fussy creature, but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.",
    "The old lady and the porter went through the flat, careful not to touch anything.",
    "Later, a police inspector looked for fingerprints while a constable checked the front door locks.",
    "There were no fingerprints, but the inspector found a bundle of jewellery, suggesting this was not the burglars' first job that day.",
    "The inspector asked the lady to check what was missing and advised her not to stay in the flat.",

    "We were staying with a small English family.",
    "At first, everything was so strange-the food, the furniture in their home, and the way they live, everything!",
    "But after three or four days, we both began to enjoy our stay, and of course, we made lots of friends at the school, which was only half a mile away.",
    "There are so many things to learn when you are in England.",
    "For example, one day my friend and I were sightseeing in London and stopped to ask an Englishman the way.",
    "“Excuse me,” I said. “Where is Albert Hall?” I thought my English was just right.",
    "“Oh,” he said, “you mean the Albert Hall!”",
    "“Yes,” I said, “where is the Albert Hall?”",
    "He then explained how to get to the Albert Hall, but I didn't realize the word 'the' was so important in English!",
    "It is impossible to overestimate what you get from foreign travel.",
    "Going to the UK made me realize how small the world is, it made me see how important travel is, and it helped me to understand what foreign visitors feel like when they visit China for the first time.",
    "The old lady's thoughts were on lunch and a good rest, but the sight of the open front door put them both out of her mind.",
    "When the old lady and the porter got back to the scene of the crime they searched the rooms for any burglars who might not have escaped.",
    "What made the police think the burglars had been disturbed? They had left behind some jewellery which did not belong to the lady.",
    "At least it was now being made easier for her to sort out the things she should have discarded years ago.",

    "They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards, and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things.",
    "As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment.",
    "Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.",
    "Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste.",
    "Among these, I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites.",

    "One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home.",
    "Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books, china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books.",
    "This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it.",
    "There are also other benefits.",
    "One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find.",

    "Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country.",
    "Over the years, one may well become an authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences.",
    "In this way, self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to talk about it.",

    "In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality.",
    "The intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand.",
    "He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party.",

    "Although being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one; and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it.",
    "An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you.",
    "Such an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was travelling alone.",

    "The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake.",
    "The porter went to fetch one and arrived back with the station master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station; this little 'o' indicated that the train only stopped for mail.",
